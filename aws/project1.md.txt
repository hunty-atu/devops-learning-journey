Objectives:
Create an Amazon VPC. 
• Create public and private subnets. 
• Create an internet gateway. 
• Configure a route table and associate it to a subnet. 
• Create an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance and make the instance publicly accessible. 
• Isolate an Amazon EC2 instance in a private subnet. 
• Create and assign security groups to Amazon EC2 instances. 
• Connect to Amazon EC2 instances using Session Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager. 

Task 1: Create an Amazon VPC in a Region 
In this task, you create a new Amazon VPC in the AWS Cloud. 
With Amazon VPC, you can provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address ranges, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. You can also use the enhanced security options in Amazon VPC to provide more granular access to and from the Amazon EC2 instances in your virtual network. 
 
3. At the top of the AWS Management Console, in the search bar, search for and choose VPC. 
! Caution: Verify that the Region displayed in the top-right corner of the console is the same as the Region value on the left side of this lab page. 
 Note: The VPC management console offers a VPC Wizard, which can automatically create several VPC architectures. However, in this lab you create the VPC components manually. 
4. In the left navigation pane, choose Your VPCs. 
The console displays a list of your currently available VPCs. A default VPC is provided so that you can launch resources as soon as you start using AWS. 
5. Choose Create VPC and configure the following: 
• Resources to create: Choose  VPC only. 
• Name tag - optional: Enter Lab VPC 
• IPv4 CIDR: Enter 10.0.0.0/16 
6. Choose Create VPC. 
A  You successfully created vpc-xxxxxxxxxx / Lab VPC message is displayed on top of the screen. 
The VPC Details page is displayed. 
7. Verify the state of the Lab VPC. 
 Expected output: It should display the following: 
• State:  Available 
ⓘ The lab VPC has a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) range of 10.0.0.0/16, which includes all IP addresses that start with 10.0.x.x. This range contains over 65,000 addresses. You later divide the addresses into separate subnets. 
8. From the same page, choose Actions ▼ and choose Edit VPC settings. 
The Edit VPC settings page is displayed. 
9. From the DNS settings section, select ☑ Enable DNS hostnames. 
This option assigns a friendly Domain Name System (DNS) name to Amazon EC2 instances in the VPC, such as the following: 
ec2-52-42-133-255.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com 
10. Choose Save. 
A  You have successfully modified the settings for vpc-xxxxxxxxxx / Lab VPC. message is displayed on top of the screen. 
Any Amazon EC2 instances launched into this Amazon VPC now automatically receive a DNS hostname. You can also create a more meaningful DNS name (for example, app.company.com) using records in Amazon Route 53. 

Task 2: Create public subnets and private subnets 
In this task, you create a public subnet and a private subnet in the lab VPC. To add a new subnet to your VPC, you must specify an IPv4 CIDR block for the subnet from the range of your VPC. You can specify the Availability Zone in which you want the subnet to reside. You can have multiple subnets in the same Availability Zone. 
 
 Note: A subnet is a sub-range of IP addresses within a network. You can launch AWS resources into a specified subnet. Use a public subnet for resources that must be connected to the internet, and use a private subnet for resources that are to remain isolated from the internet. 
Task 2.1: Create your public subnet 
The public subnet is for internet-facing resources. 
11. In the left navigation pane, choose Subnets. 
12. Choose Create subnet and configure the following: 
 Expected output: It should display the following: 
• State:  Available 
 Note: The VPC has a CIDR range of 10.0.0.0/16, which includes all 10.0.x.x IP addresses. The subnet you just created has a CIDR range of 10.0.0.0/24, which includes all 10.0.0.x IP addresses. These ranges might look similar, but the subnet is smaller than the VPC because of the /24 in the CIDR range. 
Now, configure the subnet to automatically assign a public IP address for all instances launched within it. 
15. Select ☑ Public Subnet. 
16. Choose Actions ▼ and choose Edit subnet settings. 
The Edit subnet settings page is displayed. 
17. From the Auto-assign IP settings section, select ☑ Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address. 
18. Choose Save. 
A  You have successfully changed subnet settings: Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address message is displayed on top of the screen. 
 Note: Even though this subnet is named Public Subnet, it is not yet public. A public subnet must have an internet gateway and route to the gateway. You create and attach the internet gateway and route tables in this lab. 
Task 2.2: Create your private subnet 
The private subnet is for resources that are to remain isolated from the internet. 
19. Choose Create subnet, and then configure the following: 
• VPC ID: Select Lab VPC from the dropdown menu
Expected output: It should display the following: 
• State:  Available 
 Note: The CIDR block of 10.0.2.0/23 includes all IP addresses that start with 10.0.2.x and 10.0.3.x. This is twice as large as the public subnet because most resources should be kept private, unless they specifically need to be accessible from the internet. 
Your VPC now has two subnets. However, these subnets are isolated and cannot communicate with resources outside the VPC. Next, you configure the public subnet to connect to the internet through an internet gateway. 
 Congratulations! You have successfully created a public subnet and a private subnet in the lab VPC.

Task 3: Create an internet gateway 
In this task, you create an internet gateway so that internet traffic can access the public subnet. To grant access to or from the internet for instances in a subnet in a VPC, you create an internet gateway and attach it to your VPC. Then you add a route to your subnet&apos;s route table that directs internet-bound traffic to the internet gateway. 
ⓘ Learn more: An internet gateway serves two purposes: To provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-bound traffic, and to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IPv4 addresses. 
22. In the left navigation pane, choose Internet gateways. 
23. Choose Create internet gateway and configure the following: 
• Name tag: Enter Lab IGW. 
24. Choose Create internet gateway. 
A  The following internet gateway was created: igw-xxxxxx - Lab IGW. You can now attach to a VPC to enable the VPC to communicate with the internet. message is displayed on top of the screen.

25. From the same page, choose Actions ▼ and choose Attach to VPC. 
26. For Available VPCs, select Lab VPC from the dropdown menu. 
27. Choose Attach internet gateway. 
A  Internet gateway igw-xxxxx successfully attached to vpc-xxxxx message is displayed on top of the screen. 
28. Verify the state.

Task 4: Route internet traffic in the public subnet to the internet gateway 
In this task, you create a route table and add a route to the route table to direct internet-bound traffic to your internet gateway and associate your public subnets with your route table. Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table; the table controls the routing for the subnet. A subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time, but you can associate multiple subnets with the same route table. 
ⓘ Learn more: A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed. To use an internet gateway, your subnet&apos;s route table must contain a route that directs internet-bound traffic to the internet gateway. You can scope the route to all destinations not explicitly known to the route table (0.0.0.0/0 for IPv4 or ::/0 for IPv6), or you can scope the route to a narrower range of IP addresses. If your subnet is associated with a route table that has a route to an internet gateway, it&apos;s known as a public subnet. 
29. In the left navigation pane, choose Route tables. 
There is currently one default route table associated with the VPC, Lab VPC. This routes traffic locally. You now create an additional route table to route public traffic to your internet gateway. 
30. Choose Create route table, and then configure the following: 
• Name - optional: Enter Public Route Table. 
• VPC: Select Lab VPC from the dropdown menu. 
31. Choose Create route table.

• Target: Choose Internet Gateway in the dropdown menu, and then choose the displayed internet gateway ID. 
35. Choose Save

Task 5: Create a public security group 
In this task, you create a security group so that users can access your Amazon EC2 instance. Security groups in a VPC specify which traffic is allowed to or from an Amazon EC2 instance. 
ⓘ Learn more: You can use Amazon EC2 security groups to help secure instances within an Amazon VPC. By using security groups in a VPC, you can specify both inbound and outbound network traffic that is allowed to or from each Amazon EC2 instance. Traffic that is not explicitly allowed to or from an instance is automatically denied. 
 Security: It is recommended to use HTTPS protocol to improve web traffic security. However, to simplify this lab, only HTTP protocol is used. 
40. In the left navigation pane, choose Security groups. 
41. Choose Create security group, and then configure the following: 
• Security group name: Enter Public SG. 
• Description: Enter Allows incoming traffic to public instance.

• Value: Enter Public SG. 
44. Choose Create security group. 
A  Security group (sg-xxxxxxx | Public SG) was created successfully message is displayed on top of the screen. 
 Congratulations! You have successfully created a security group that allows HTTP traffic. You need this in the next task when you launch an Amazon EC2 instance in the public subnet. 

Task 6: Launch an Amazon EC2 instance into a public subnet 
In this task, you launch an Amazon EC2 instance into a public subnet. To activate communication over the internet for IPv4, your instance must have a public IPv4 address that&apos;s associated with a private IPv4 address on your instance. By default, your instance is only aware of the private (internal) IP address space defined within the VPC and subnet. 
 
ⓘ Learn more: The internet gateway that you created logically provides the one-to-one NAT on behalf of your instance. So when traffic leaves your VPC subnet and goes to the internet, the reply address field is set to the public IPv4 address or Elastic IP address of your instance, and not its private IP address. 
45. At the top of the AWS Management Console, in the search bar, search for and choose EC2.

Task 9: Create a NAT gateway and configuring routing in the private subnet 
In this task, you create a NAT gateway and then create a route table to route non-local traffic to the NAT gateway. You then attach the route table to the private subnet. You can use a NAT gateway to allow instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevent the internet from initiating a connection with those instances. 
 Note: To create a NAT gateway, you must specify the public subnet in which the NAT gateway should reside. You must also specify an Elastic IP address to associate with the NAT gateway when you create it. You cannot change the Elastic IP address after you associate it with the NAT gateway. After you&apos;ve created a NAT gateway, you must update the route table associated with one or more of your private subnets to point internet-bound traffic to the NAT gateway. This allows instances in your private subnets to communicate with the internet. 
82. Return to the AWS Management Console browser tab.

ⓘ Learn more: Private instances can route their traffic through a NAT gateway or a NAT instance to access the internet. Private instances use the public IP address of the NAT gateway or NAT instance to traverse the internet. The NAT gateway or NAT instance allows outbound communication but doesn’t allow machines on the internet to initiate a connection to the privately addressed instances.
