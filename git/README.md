## Learnings
Cloning is simply the process of downloading a GitHub project from an online repository to your local machine using Git.

Once itâ€™s on your local machine, you can make edits to your local copy and PUSH your code or PULL changes made to the online repository into your local copy of the project using Git.
Branch
What is Git Branching?

Git branching allows developers to diverge from the production version of code to fix a bug or add a feature.
Developers create branches to work with a copy of the code without changing the current version.
$ git checkout -b <branch-name>
Example: $ git checkout -b My_Spring_uni_Branch
