## Learnings
Git clone is used for the initial setup to copy a repository, while git pull is used to update an existing local repository with changes from the remote repository.

Developers create branches to work with a copy of the code without changing the current version.
$ git checkout -b <branch-name>
Example: $ git checkout -b My_Spring_uni_Branch
