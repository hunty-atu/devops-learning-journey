# Project 4: Conflicts

### Steps

##Version control helps teams solve any code problems or conflicts.

•	Did one of your colleagues edit the same file on the same lines as you? 
•	Did they delete a file that you modified? 
•	Did you both add a file with the same name?
•	Git will tell you that you have “unmerged paths” (which another way of telling you that you have one or more conflicts) via “git status” command:

**In Git conflicts only occur on your local machine - and not on the server.**
