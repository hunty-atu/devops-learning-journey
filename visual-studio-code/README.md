## Check IntelliCode

1. **Open Extensions**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (Mac) to open the Extensions view.
2. **Search for IntelliCode**: Type "IntelliCode" in the search bar and ensure the extension is installed and enabled.
3. For Bash scripts, you might also want to install the **"Bash IDE"** extension, which provides language support for Bash, including code completion and other IntelliSense features.
